# projectile
Helps find certain variables with physics 2d motion projectiles. 

This program assumes that you have the initial height, velocity, and angle the projectile is shot at. 


When asked what to find the program is asking would you like to find airtime, and range. 
Cmds:
Both - gives both time and distance of projectile 
time - gives time that projectile was in air
distance - give the distance of projectile

After the program runs the output should give you what you have requested and then prompt another question. 
"Would you like to know a height at a time?"
If the response is yes, the program will then ask:
"What time?"
When given a time the program will give a final output of the height at the given time.
